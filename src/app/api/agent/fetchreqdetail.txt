Steps for chatbot:
    1. Before sending the message to the agent you have to start up the chatbot by sending a request to:
        /api/agent
        and using this code :
        '''
        const res: ResponseJson = await fetch("/api/agent", {
            method: "POST",
            headers: {
                "Content-Type": "application/json",
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({
                status: "start"
            })
        }).then((res) => res.json());
        '''
        the body with a status: "start" is a must.
        - Doing this we will recieve a response in this format:
        {
            status: 200,
            thread: threadId
        } 
        (Storing the thread is a must!)
        or (in case of an error):
        {
            status: 400
        } 
    2. Now you can send messages to the agent to the same request (/api/agent) but in this format: 
        '''
        const res: ResponseJson = await fetch("/api/agent", {
            method: "POST",
            headers: {
                "Content-Type": "application/json",
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({
                status: "send",
                thread: thread,
                message: tempMsg
            })
        }).then((res) => res.json());
        '''
        The body is a must and the keys should be exactly the same.
        Doing this you will get a response in this format: 
        {
            status: 200,
            reply: "Some String"
        }
        or (in case of an error):
        {
            status: 400
        }
